// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisAndRequirement = "This is the second step, the management teams  need to collection all of requirements from stakeholders. After we get requirement enough so we can start analysis. What is the languages, frameworks, and server that we want to using in the project."

const design = "This is the third step, The architectures using method Flowchart, Draw Diagram, Pseudocode, and so on. of system work and the designs try to design UX/UI adapt to user experience"

const implementation = "This is the four step, the developers try to implement (coding) follow that system was designed (translate everything into real solution)."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the five step, We have many way in this process, sometimes, we need to use QA to testing the flow of the system or the developers involve create a test case in Unit-Test. Otherwise we can using automatically testing CI/CD. To make sure our implementation match everything with requirement."

const maintain = "This is the final step, We need to maintain system depending on fixing an error or add new features for the next version."
